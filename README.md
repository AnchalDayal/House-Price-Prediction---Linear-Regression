# **House Price Prediction using Linear Regression**

This project is aimed at predicting house prices based on various features using a **linear regression model**. The dataset contains information such as the number of bedrooms, living area, lot area, and other key features that influence house prices. The objective of this project is to build a regression model that can accurately predict the price of a house based on these features.

#### **Dataset Overview:**
- The dataset contains 14,620 entries and 23 columns, with the target variable being the house **price**.
- Features include: number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, living area, lot area, grade of the house, renovation year, proximity to schools, distance from the airport, and more.

#### **Key Steps:**
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and preparing data for model training.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Analyzing the dataset to select the most important features and remove irrelevant ones.
3. **Model Building**: Building a linear regression model to predict house prices.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of the model using metrics like **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, and **R-squared**.
5. **Data Visualization**: Visualizing the relationships between actual vs. predicted prices, residuals, and feature importance.

#### **Key Visualizations:**
- **Actual vs Predicted Prices (Scatter Plot)**: Shows the correlation between the predicted and actual house prices.
- **Residuals Plot**: Helps evaluate the model's error distribution.
- **Residual Distribution:** Ensure errors are normally distributed.
- **Predicted vs Actual Distribution:** Compare price distributions.
- **Correlation Heatmap:** Examine relationships between features and target.
- **Pairplot:** Investigate interactions between key features..

#### **Technologies Used:**
- **Python**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **NumPy** for numerical operations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning model implementation

#### **Goals:**
- Develop a regression model that predicts house prices with high accuracy.
- Provide insights into the most influential factors affecting house prices.
- Visualize the modelâ€™s performance and data patterns to refine future predictions.
